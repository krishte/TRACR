### The Scheduling Algorithm

The app is made up of five main pages: Home, Assignments, Classes, Progress, and Settings. The following sections detail the functionality of each of these pages with a few images.

### Home

This is the page shown when the app is launched. Depending on whether the user wants their tasks to scheduled at specific times or they just want a general checklist of how long to spend on each assignment, this page can be toggled between Specific times and Daiily checklist respectively. The Tasks backlog (top-right button) displays all past incomplete tasks. The user can then select how much of the task they actually completed, and the scheduling algorithms then adjusts the future schedule accordingly. 

|Specific times|Daily checklist|Tasks backlog|
|---|---|---|

### Classes

This page displays all a users' classes and on a class leads to the Specific class page where the assignments for that class both complete and incomplete are displayed. The floating add button in the bottom-right is present in all pages. Tapping it gives three options: add a class, add an assignment, and add a grade. The Add class page is shown below.
