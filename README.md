## Overview

- **International Baccleaurate Integration** - For students taking the International Baccleaurate (IB) TRACR displays real IB statistics 

### The Scheduling Algorithm

The app is made up of five main sections: Home, Assignments, Classes, Progress, and Settings. The following sections detail the functionality of each of these sections with a few images.

### Home

This is the page shown when the app is launched. Depending on whether the user wants their tasks to scheduled at specific times or they just want a general checklist of how long to spend on each assignment, this page can be toggled between Specific times and Daiily checklist respectively. The Tasks backlog (top-right button) displays all past incomplete tasks. The user can then select how much of the task they actually completed, and the scheduling algorithms then adjusts the future schedule accordingly. 

|Specific times|Daily checklist|Tasks backlog|
